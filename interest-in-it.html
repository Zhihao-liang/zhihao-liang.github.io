				<h1>Where it started</h1>
				<p>When I was in primary school, I had an information technology course. In the course, I learned
					scratch which is a free programming language targeted at children. I still remembered the cute cat
					logo. With the help of my IT teacher, I wrote a simple game called Greedy Snake. When I saw the
					snake moving properly, I got a sense of achievement. Scratch made me understand that information
					technology can create unlimited possibilities.
					When I was in middle school, I attended an IT club. There are many smart members in the club. I was
					exposed to more IT knowledge. I learnt C and made a C version of Greedy Snake. I also studied simple
					HTML and tried to make a personal blog website. Although there is only one class (45 minutes) per
					week for IT club activities, the experience in the IT club still sparked my interest in IT and
					pushed me to major in computer science at university.
				</p>
				<h1>Why RMIT</h1>
				<p>There are many reasons to choose RMIT. First, RMIT has a good ranking amongst universities and its
					subject ranking of computer science is also high. So, I can communicate with more great professors
					and make more outstanding friends in this outstanding university. Second, RMIT has a great
					reputation in the IT industry. A number of schoolfellows worked in famous IT companies such as
					Microsoft, Google, Amazon and so on. This means that it is not hard to get a good job after
					graduation. Third, the buildings of RMIT are amazing. I enjoy roaming around the big campus.</p>
				<h1>Expectations</h1>

				I expect to learn various areas of knowledge in IT such as machine learning, data science, web
				application development and so on. I would like to broaden my IT knowledge and try to be a full-stack
				developer in the future. Ideally, I can use Pytorch to do deep learning tasks, use Vue.js to build a
				user interface efficiently, and use spider technology such as Scrapy to obtain data on the Internet. In
				the future, I would like to be a Java back-end engineer as my first job.
