				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>This application is a large emergency response system. For citizens, they can send rescue requests
					when their lives are threatened by extreme situations, learn survival skills and check extreme
					situation warnings. For the emergency department, they can update their refuge location and mark
					them on the digital map. The rescue information aggregation platform is not only for those who
					suffer from emergency situations but also for rescue teams. Rescue teams can receive rescue requests
					for this platform to have a better emergency response to save more lives. </p>
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>Extreme natural disasters are often characterised as “black swans” and extreme events are hard to
					predict. As rapidly growing populations mean that more and more people living everywhere, the impact
					of each natural disaster is felt by increasing numbers of people. For example, since 12 July 2021,
					several European countries have been affected by floods, some were catastrophic, causing deaths and
					widespread damage. Since 17 July 2021, China's Henan province has been affected by severe flooding,
					caused by a period of prolonged heavy rainfall. The death toll in China’s Henan floods triples to
					302, dozens missing. After watching interviews with victims, the bad emergency response speed is a
					remarkable reason for causing more death. So I try to design a mobile application that can warn
					people, help people survive and support rescue teams to aggregate disaster situations.
				</p>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>There are three parts to this mobile application. The first part is an early-warning system. The
					application gets the user’s location with the user’s permission and sends natural disaster warnings
					based on the location. Warning posts have professional suggestions and are updated in real-time. For
					example, if there is a storm alert post, rainfall in certain areas will be updated in real-time. The
					second part is helping people survive in an extreme natural disaster. The application saves a number
					of survival skills. Users can learn about how to survive in extreme natural disasters like
					earthquakes, volcanoes, forest fires and so on. Related data is downloaded in advance because when
					users meet these situations, the network could be unavailable. Survival knowledge is reviewed by
					experts and users do not need to search related information on the Internet. For example, the
					application can teach what you can do when your house is flooded, how to avoid being swept away by
					the flood, how to do CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and so on. Moreover, users can have a map
					with refuge locations. The offline refuge map also is maintained by the admin. When the network is
					broken, users still can go to the nearest refuge. The last part is rescue teams support system which
					can coordinate volunteers and donated material. When an unpredictable disaster occurs, recuse teams
					can share their supply situations and assessments of disaster on this platform so that they can
					coordinate rescue forces. Moreover, when users meet a terrible situation, they can send a rescue
					request with photos and a video to the system. The request is visible to all people. This means that
					citizens can help each other when official rescue teams cannot arrive on time. Volunteers also send
					posts for providing their help. The application also can show contact details of all kinds of
					emergency phones such as 000.
				</p>
				<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
				<p>To be able to make this application work, users should have a smartphone with a GPS system. First of
					all, I need a computer or a laptop. In the development stage, Spring Boot which is a Java backend
					framework is an option to build the project's backend. In order to make the application across all
					platforms, Flutter will be used. So, I can use Android studio and Vscode to write code. In the
					testing part, Postman can be used to do API testing and Junit can test key business functions. I
					also need an Android device and an iphone to do usability testing. In the deployment part, I can set
					up a cloud machine in AWS and use Docker to deploy the project's backend.</p>
				<h3>Skills Required</h3>
				<p>To implement the features, I try to build the server-side using Spring Boot which is a popular Java
					backend framework so I need to know Object-Oriented Programming and Java very well. To build the
					interface, Flutter is a suitable option because Flutter is a cross-platform, open-source mobile SDK
					build by Dart. So, I need to learn Dart. In order to deploy our application, I need to have a cloud
					virtual machine such as EC2 in AWS. To operate the cloud machine, I should learn Linux. It is not
					easy to learn all of them, but there are so many online resources and related documentation for
					these technologies.
				</p>
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>Upon success of the application, the public can receive extreme weather alter and evacuate to the
					nearest shelter in advance. Moreover, when people meet extreme natural disasters, emergency response
					can be more efficient. People also can take advantage of the skills and the refuge map in the
					application to help themselves. People afflicted by a natural disaster can send help requests and
					rescue teams can acquire help messages to provide help. The application can save more lives in the
					future.
