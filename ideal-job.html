					expand a cloud-based suite of commercial applications. I need to design a cloud-based application
					with stakeholdersâ€™ requirements. I also need to develop new libraries and reusable code for my
					colleagues. The reason why this job attracts me is this is an international company. Wellcom
					Worldwide operates in nine locations globally including Australia, Asia, UK, USA and New Zealand. I
					can have a global perspective in the company. The salary of this job is also satisfactory. I can
					have a better quality of life if I work for this company. Moreover, this job also gives me the
					chance to communicate with stakeholders and customers, design new products based on their insight
					and resolve software development problems with my team members.
				</p>
				<p>There are a number of requirements for this job. First, I need to have at least 4 years of working
					experience in back-end development. Moreover, I need to be skilful at Java, Spring, Hibernate,
					WebObjects, SQL, HTML, CSS, Angular, JavaScript, REST services with JSON and XML, SDLC, MVC,

				</p>
				<p>The current qualifications I have is a basic understanding of IT technologies and a basic programming
					skill. I learned Java programming and Git in Programming 1. I also know a little bit of SQL because
					I took a database course. I tried to build a personal website when I was young, so I know HTML and
					CSS. In the future, I will select relevant courses to improve my programming skills and learn
					required concepts, such as web programming and software engineering. After finishing my bachelor of
					Information Technology, I intend to continue my studies in the master of software engineering (Cloud
					Computing). I also plan on getting any relevant certificate that can boost my career, such as AWS
					Certification. After graduation, I am going to interview some Internet companies recruiting
					graduates and try to accumulate experience and develop competitiveness. When I get enough work
					experience and can be a leader in a small team, I will interview my dream company.
