				<p>For the result of the first test: the Myers-Briggs test, I am an INTP-A called Logician. I stands for
					Introverted, N for Intuitive, T for Thinking, P for Prospecting and A for Assertive. Introversion
					means that I prefer staying with just one or two people, rather than large groups. I am more
					comfortable focusing on my inner world, rather than what's happening externally. Intuition means
					that I always closely observe my surroundings and do not care about the details of things. I am
					interested in the big picture of things. Thinking means that I prefer to collect objective
					information to make decisions. Knowledge is my vital tool to verify my thinking. I sometimes dismiss
					emotional responses, either my own or those of others. Prospecting means I can handle unexpected
					challenges flexibly. I also can catch unexpected opportunities because of my flexibility. </p>

						<h2>Summary</h2>
					</div>
				</header>
				<p>The results of these tests helped me understand myself. When forming a group I know that I may not be
					a
					good leader and I would do a good job following the leader's arrangement. Charts, graphs and videos
					will
					also support my learning. Overall, the results of my exams combined indicate that I am a rational
					person
					and good at analyzing questions. I can do review work before submitting group assignments. In group
					discussions, I should try to be confident and express more ideas.</p>
